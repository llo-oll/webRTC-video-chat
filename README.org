* WebRTC Video Chat
This currently provides two way video chat between two clients using WebRTC.

The server provides the signalling capability for the clients to create a peer to peer connection between themselves.

** SSL certificates
The server uses https. To self sign certificates for use during development use openssl in the root directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes -days 365 -subj '/CN=localhost'
#+END_SRC
